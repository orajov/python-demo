# 09 – Reading files and context managers

Goal: open files safely and manage resources with `with` blocks.

## Checklist
- Observe the context manager pattern in `examples.py`.
- Write a small reader in `exercises.py` that strips trailing whitespace.
- Handle missing files with friendly errors.

## Commands
```sh
py examples.py
py exercises.py
```
