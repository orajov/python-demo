# 06 – Number representation and rounding

Goal: understand how Python stores integers and floats and how to avoid common precision issues.

## Checklist
- Inspect integer limits and arbitrary precision in `examples.py`.
- See floating-point rounding quirks and how to format numbers.
- Implement safe comparisons in `exercises.py` using tolerances.

## Commands
```sh
py examples.py
py exercises.py
```
