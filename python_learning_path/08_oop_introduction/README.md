# 08 – Introduction to OOP

Goal: create simple classes, work with attributes, and define methods.

## Checklist
- Study the `User` class in `examples.py`.
- Implement `Book` in `exercises.py` with methods and a class attribute.
- Practice `__str__` to make objects readable.

## Commands
```sh
py examples.py
py exercises.py
```
