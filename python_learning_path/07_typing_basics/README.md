# 07 – Dynamic vs static typing, typing in Python

Goal: see how Python is dynamically typed and how optional type hints help tools.

## Checklist
- Compare untyped and typed functions in `examples.py`.
- Run `py exercises.py` and intentionally pass wrong types to see runtime errors.
- Annotate the helper in `exercises.py` with precise types.

## Commands
```sh
py examples.py
py exercises.py
```
